Introduction
This project aims to segment football fields from images using the YOLOv8 model. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art model that provides fast and accurate segmentation, making it ideal for real-time applications like sports analytics.

Installation
To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
!pip install ultralytics
This will install the ultralytics package, which includes YOLOv8.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model includes images of football fields. The images are annotated with bounding boxes or masks indicating the football fields.

Model Training
The training process is initiated after setting up the dataset. The notebook provides step-by-step instructions on how to configure the model and start the training process.

python
Copy code
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('yolov8n-seg.pt')  # Load a pretrained YOLOv8 segmentation model
model.train(data='data.yaml', epochs=50, imgsz=640)
Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Mean Average Precision (mAP). The notebook includes code to visualize the results and evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset.

Results
The results section displays the model's predictions on a few test images, along with metrics that quantify its performance.
